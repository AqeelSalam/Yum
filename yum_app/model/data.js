        "5 stars for a fantastic bar showcasing the Cherry Blossom Festival! Honestly, this place is awesome. Awesome interior and decor, awesome drinks and an awesome bar. This place isn't extremely large, so you may have to wait in a line. However, there's no cover and the line moves pretty fast.My friend and I came here on a Friday around nine. We both loved the decor and managed to find a spot at the bar pretty quickly. We started with the Love Crazed Monster and the God, Alpha Predator, Godzilla. The Love Crazed Monster was tea based and excellent. The Godzilla was pretty good but not very strong. After drinks, we meandered around and saw all of the rooms. Each one is themed and decorated meticulously. There are also bars in each room so it's pretty easy to get a drink! We moved to the paper crane room for our next drink. We ordered the Cherry Blossom Festival Ale and the Way of the Tea. Both were awesome. The beer was a genuinely tasty saison and the Way of the Tea was an excellent cocktail. Overall, this was a fabulous bar that got me excited for the Cherry Blossom Festival!",
        "Nice visual experience to enjoy. However, as far as drinks this isn/'t the place for you to go and get a buzz- drinks were weak on the alcohol.Grab a cocktail, the Loved Craved Monster is good, walk throughout the rooms and settle on a restaurant to go to after for dinner and drinks.",
        "Decoration looks great and the bartenders are nice but the drinks were horrible.  We had four of them off the menu.  The caprico, the Godzilla, way of the tea, and there goes Tokyo. None of which I would consider great or worth the $13 or some odd dollars it was per drink.  You're better off grabbing a beer or asking for a classic and take in the vibes/scenery.  Get all your IG pics or what have you and move on."

        "Had not been back to Old Ebbitt Grill in 10 years and we were pleasantly surprised to find it as nice as we remembered. Both food and service were good. It is a reliable place to dine in central DC.",
        "This is one of Washington Dc's classic restaurants and is good for anytime of day. The food is great and the decor is amazing. The wait staff can be hit or miss but well worth a visit. Give yourself some time to wait or make a reservation as this place is popular. Located right near the White House. enjoy!"
